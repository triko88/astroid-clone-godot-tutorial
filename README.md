# Astroid Clone on Godot 3.1

Want to get started with Godot Engine but don't know where to start? In that case, this code base might help you. 
This repository is primarily used for my YouTube tutorial series on Godot 3.1 (stable). With this code base, you'll learn how to:

* Create your own games with Godot Engine and gain confidence.
* Master GDScript, Godot's custom scripting language that strikes the balence between performance and convinience.
* Prototype games rapidly for game jams.
* Organize your game assets for better accessability and productivity.
